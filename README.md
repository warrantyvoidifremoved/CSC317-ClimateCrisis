We chose to use IBM Plex Serif as the font throughout the website.

On mobile, the websiteâ€™s navbar ended up appearing too cluttered at the top of the page, with both the site name and other buttons squished together, as well as the navbar being cropped off the page. We decided to only keep the main title on the navbar and add a dropdown menu that displays the other navbar items once tapped.
