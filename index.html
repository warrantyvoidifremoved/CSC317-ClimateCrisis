            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Water scarcity is a pressing global issue characterized by insufficient freshwater resources to meet
                    human and ecological needs. While approximately 70% of Earth's surface is covered by water, only about 2.5% of
                    it is freshwater, and an even smaller fraction is readily accessible for human use. Increasing population
                    growth, urbanization, climate change, and inefficient water management practices have exacerbated the
                    situation, making water scarcity one of the most critical environmental and humanitarian challenges of
                    our time.

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Agriculture is the largest consumer of freshwater, accounting for nearly 70% of global withdrawals.
                    However, outdated irrigation methods, such as flood irrigation, contribute significantly to water waste. The
                    transition to sustainable agricultural practices, including drip irrigation, crop rotation,
                    drought-resistant crops, and precision agriculture technologies, is essential to reducing water
                    consumption. Implementing these strategies can lead to substantial water savings and enhance food security in
                    water-stressed regions.

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Climate change is intensifying water scarcity by altering rainfall patterns, accelerating evaporation
                    rates, and melting glaciers that traditionally replenish freshwater supplies. In regions that already face
                    drought conditions, these effects are worsening water availability, impacting ecosystems and threatening human
                    livelihoods. Addressing climate change through mitigation measures, such as reducing greenhouse gas
                    emissions, alongside adaptive water management strategies, is vital to safeguarding water resources.

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Rapid urbanization and industrial growth place enormous pressure on freshwater systems. Cities consume
                    large quantities of water for domestic, commercial, and industrial purposes, often leading to groundwater
                    depletion and pollution of rivers and lakes. To alleviate urban water stress, sustainable city planning
                    initiatives, including rainwater harvesting, wastewater recycling, and water-efficient infrastructure,
                    must be integrated into urban development policies.

            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <p>Water scarcity significantly impacts economies, especially in developing regions reliant on agriculture
                    and industry. Shortages can hinder economic growth, drive up food prices, increase poverty levels, and
                    potentially lead to social conflicts. Investing in water infrastructure, promoting efficient water use,
                    and developing economic incentives for conservation are necessary steps to mitigate the economic
                    repercussions of water shortages and support sustainable development.</p>

            <div class="text">
                <p>
                    Technological advancements offer promising solutions to address water scarcity. Innovations such as
                    desalination, water recycling technologies, and smart metering systems can substantially reduce
                    freshwater consumption and increase efficiency. Desalination plants convert seawater into potable water, while
                    advanced wastewater treatment technologies allow for safe reuse of wastewater for agricultural or industrial
                    purposes. Integrating these technologies on a broader scale could significantly alleviate global water
                    scarcity challenges.
